Program to find factors of a given number. Using number systems logic. First we find the prime factors of a number and then find the count of the prime factors, example say number is 30, it has 3 prime factors 2, 3, 5 all are present 1 times so the formula to get all factors are (1+1)*(1+1)*(1+1) i.e 8. Lets look at another example say the number is 100, we have two prime factors 2 and 5 both are present two times so using the formula we will have (2+1)*(2+1) i.e equal to 9.
